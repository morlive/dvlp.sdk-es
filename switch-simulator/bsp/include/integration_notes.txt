/**
* Integration Notes:
*
* HAL Integration:
* - This BSP layer provides hardware abstraction for HAL components
* - HAL port.h should use bsp_port_* functions for hardware operations
* - HAL packet.h can use BSP resource allocation for buffer management
*
* SAI Compatibility:
* - BSP provides foundation for SAI adapter implementation
* - Port configurations map directly to SAI port attributes
* - QoS structures align with SAI QoS model
* - Statistics counters follow SAI counter naming conventions
*
* Python Bindings:
* - Consider creating Python wrappers for BSP API
* - Use ctypes or SWIG for automatic binding generation
* - Expose port status and statistics for monitoring tools
